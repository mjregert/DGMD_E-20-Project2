                    <h3>June 22, 2004</h3>
                    <p>Carey and I filled out our application to adopt a second child with World Partners
                        Adoption. We're hoping to adopt a 6 month old boy. There are two reasons we decided
                        to adopt a boy again. First, there are a lot more boys needing to be adopted
                        than girls. We just couldn't leave the little boys over there knowing the need
                        a home too. Secondly, we decided Ayden could use a little brother to play with.
                        If needed we could bunk them and heck, we already have tons of boy's toys and
                        clothes.

                    <p>I don't have the exact day ,but at the end of June ,we filled out our INS Form I-600-A,
                        which is a form that starts the process and tells the government that we are
                        going to do an international adoption.</p>

                    <h3>August 13, 2004</h3>
                    <p>We did our home study with the social worker. This is a required long interview with
                        a social worker to make sure that we are capable of adopting a child.

                    <p>We've been waiting for our first draft of our home study and finally got it today.
                        We sent if off to World Partners for approval.

                    <h3>October 1, 2004</h3>
                    <p>After more waiting and problems with our social worker, we finally received the final
                        draft of our home study. We also went to the Secretary of State's office to get
                        all of our documents apostiled. This means all of our paperwork is finally finished.
                        We will mail it off to INS on Monday, October 4, 2004.
