            <h2>As we went through the first adoption process, I tried to document all of the major events that happened,
                both good and bad. I tried to do the same for our second adoption.  I still need to finish the end events.

                <h3>June 22, 2004</h3>
                <p>Carey and I filled out our application to adopt a second child with World Partners Adoption. We're hoping to adopt a 6 month old boy. There are two reasons we decided to adopt a boy again. First, there are a lot more boys needing to be
                    adopted than girls. We just couldn't leave the little boys over there knowing the need a home too. Secondly, we decided Ayden could use a little brother to play with. If needed we could bunk them and heck, we already have tons of boy's
                    toys and clothes.

                <p>I don't have the exact day ,but at the end of June ,we filled out our INS Form I-600-A, which is a form that starts the process and tells the government that we are going to do an international adoption.</p>

                <h3>August 13, 2004</h3>
                <p>We did our home study with the social worker. This is a required long interview with a social worker to make sure that we are capable of adopting a child.

                <h3>October 1, 2004</h3>
                <p>After more waiting and problems with our social worker, we finally received the final draft of our home study. We also went to the Secretary of State's office to get all of our documents apostiled. This means all of our paperwork is finally
                    finished. We will mail it off to INS on Monday, October 4, 2004.
