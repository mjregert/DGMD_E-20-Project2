                <h2>About our Family</h2>
                <p> Carey and I are the proud parents of two wonderful boys, Ayden and Brennan. We adopted from Kazakhstan. Ayden was adopted from Almaty, Kazakhstan in April 2003 at the age of 13 months. Two years later, we adopted Brennan from Karaganda,
                    Kazakhstan in April 2005 at the age of 9 months. In 2014, we housed an amazing exchange student from Almaty, Kazakhstan. Amina lived with us for a year and attended high school as a Junior (based on her age) although it was technically
                    her last year of high school in her county. She is now attending one of the top medical’ universities in Kazakhstan. We consider her our “adopted” daughter and are very proud of her accomplishments.</p>

                <h2>Why International Adoption?</h2>
                <p> Many people ask us why we decided to do an international adoption from Kazakhstan. Carey and I started out being foster and adoption certified with the state of Texas. After a few months of waiting on the state, a friend recommended that
                    we pursue international adoption at the same time. There are both pros and cons to each so I’m not saying one is better than the other. Adopting through the state is inexpensive, and provides perks such as free services for the children,
                    and college tuition for in-state colleges when they’re older. Yet, many of the children can have physical and emotional problems since many are removed from their homes due to alcohol, drugs, and abuse. Another reason Carey and I decided
                    on international adoption is that there is less risk in having the adoption fall through due to a family member (grandparent, etc.) appearing at the last minute. We had many friends who were fostering to adopt, and had the children
                    either removed at the last moment to a family member, or returned to their biological parents due to court orders. Heartbreaking and Carey and I were not emotionally ready for that. International adoptions are much more expensive,
                    but in many cases, have less risk associated with them. Many if not most of the children available are up for adoption due to their economy. This means that many of the children are, in general, healthier and have fewer problems than
                    the children available from the state.</p>

                <h2>Why Kazakhstan?</h2>
                <p> We first wanted to adopt from Romania, since my father was born in Romania. But due to all of the bad press the Romania orphanages had received, they had closed the adoptions to the US. The friend recommended World Partner Adoption agency
                    out of Atlanta, GA. We traveled with a referral both times. We felt more comfortable traveling with a referral because you can get the baby's medical information checked out before you travel and make a decision before you fall in-love
                    with them. Traveling blind is a little scary to us because there is always the chance you will not find what you are looking for. I have heard of people coming back empty handed. It is hard for us to explain but when you see the photos
                    of your child, you just know that they are your forever child. Kazakhstan has more boys than girls, and there are plenty of boys under 2, which is why we ended up with two boys (we told them we’d accept any child, boy or girl).</p>
