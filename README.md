Assignment 2: Positioning, Accessibility, CSS3 Styling
 Submit Assignment
Due Oct 21 by 10:59pm  Points 100  Submitting a file upload
NOTE: October 13: Assignment submission instructions updated to be Canvas-compatible! Assignment itself has not changed.

This assignment is due on October 21, 2016, by 11:59 PM Eastern time. This assignment is worth 25% of your course grade, or 100 points.

Create a 2-3 page website about a topic of your choosing. Your topic should be legal, ethical, moral, and safe for work. If you have a question about your topic and its appropriateness, ask!

Incorporate the following into the web site:

Floats and positioning (50% of grade)
Include a standard navigation bar linking all pages together. The navigation bar should be in the same location and styled similarly between pages.
Create a two-column or three-column layout in your design.
The above two points are compatible with the following three requirements. (That means you can combine them! For example, you could combine the nav bar requirement with a layout method.):
You should make use of a float and a clear at least twice in your site.
You should make use of absolute, relative, or fixed positioning at least once in your site.
Demonstrate the correct use of CSS3 columns OR styling with inline-block. (You are welcome to do both.)
Styling with CSS3 styles (25% of grade)
Demonstrate at least 3 of the following techniques in your site:
Web fonts
Rounded corners
Box/drop shadows
Border images
Transparency in images and/or background color
Gradients
Accessibility (coming soon) (25% of grade)
Make sure you have incorporated five of the six core skills (Links to an external site.) for achieving web accessibility into your site. (Video is not required.) Include an image and a list, if they are not in your site already. Evaluate your color scheme for adequate contrast using a contrast checker tool.
Include navigation best practices in your website: skip links, landmarks, onfocus styling, correct use of headings.
Demonstrate at least one appropriate use of an ARIA role, control, label, or state. (This can be combined with other requirements.)
Create a table of information and mark it up for full accessibility. (This is a table of data, of course -- there are no layout tables in this course!)
Additional requirements

Please write your own content for this website. Do not copy content from Wikipedia or some other source. I’d like you to write your own markup from scratch, not copy the markup from some other website and plop it into your document. It’s easy to copy markup if you’re copying content from the web.

If you need images for your site, you can find many free image websites online. I like http://www.freeimages.com/ (Links to an external site.) but there are many others. Remember that only .jpg, .png, and .gif images work on the web, and remember that you should resize your images to optimize download time. You are also welcome to use image placeholder services like lorempixel.com.

Post your website on your web hosting space, whether that’s at SiteGround or another service.

What Jen cares about

You follow the instructions. That includes “How to Turn In The Assignment”, below. Students who do not follow instructions about how to turn in the assignment receive an F. Instructions are listed because we need to streamline the grading process for rapid grading turnaround.
Your code is valid HTML5 and CSS3 code that works with some combination of Mac/PC/Chrome/Firefox.
What Jen doesn’t care about

Your graphic design and color matching abilities/inabilities don’t matter to me. Neither does your ability/inability to make pretty pictures.
Cross-browser compatibility does not matter. Valid and standards-compliant code does matter.
How to turn in your assignment

Turn your assignment in via the Assignment 2 link in Canvas.

Create a zipped file that contains the following information:

Include a link to your website.
In a document (Word or text), please detail the following:
Floats are demonstrated here: ___________ (URL of page and line numbers for HTML and CSS)
Positioning is demonstrated here: ___________ (URL of page and line numbers for HTML and CSS)
The 3 CSS3 techniques I used on the site are: ___________ And the CSS line numbers for those techniques are here: _____________
We will evaluate your site for semantic markup, including proper use of headers, lists, tables, and images. We will check for appropriate accessibility requirements for these as well as described in lecture and the reading.
We will evaluate your image(s) for (an) appropriate alt tag(s).
Indicate the line of HTML where the Aria role, control, state, or label is located.
Indicate the line of HTML where your table starts.
Provide a screenshot of your color analysis, demonstrating adequate contrast between background and text. (If you have more than one color pair involved, provide screenshots for no more than 3 of these combinations.)
NOTE: If you try to submit the file AND a Canvas comment, chances are that we will NOT receive the Canvas comment! Please double-check your submission to make sure that all of this information is received.

If you submit your assignment multiple times, that's fine. We grade the final, most recent submission and ignore the others, so make sure the assignment you want graded is the most recent submission.

Help! I’m going to be late!

It is expected that you will turn the assignment in on time.

If you are unable to turn the assignment in on time, you must notify Erin Schroeder by email (erinmarieboyle@gmail.com) no less than 24 hours before the assignment is due. It is unlikely that you will get more than a 24-hour extension, unless a major life event has affected you recently.

If this email is not received, you will receive a zero for the assignment.  

Grades will be posted in Canvas when they are ready. Typically assignments are graded within 1 week.

Regrading of assignment

Regrade of this assignment is permitted. If you are dissatisfied with a grade you receive on this assignment, you may resubmit the assignment for review. This resubmission must occur within 3 days of receiving your grade. If you choose to resubmit your assignment, please email Erin Schroeder (erinmarieboyle@gmail.com) that you have done so.
